# CAR Dealership Database

## Description of the Project
The CAR Dealership Database is a database project aimed at organizing and managing data for vehicle dealerships. This database allows for efficient tracking of vehicle inventory, dealership details, and customer transactions, including both sales and leases. It serves as a foundation for building dealership software solutions.

### Features
- **Dealership Data**: Keeps essential details about each dealership, including their location and contact information.
- **Comprehensive Vehicle Records**: Maintains data on all vehicles, including specifications, pricing, and availability.
- **Inventory Linking**: Tracks which vehicles are available at specific dealerships, enabling streamlined inventory checks.
- **Sales and Leasing Modules**: Records customer sales and lease transactions, including relevant fees, taxes, and terms.

## Setup Instructions
- **Create the Database**: Use the SQL script provided to set up the database structure in MySQL Workbench.
- **Insert Initial Data**: Populate the database with sample data, including 10 vehicles and 2 dealerships.
- **Execute Test Queries**: Run queries to retrieve, manage, and verify database data.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL Workbench**: Used to design, execute, and manage the database.
